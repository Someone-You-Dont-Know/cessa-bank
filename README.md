### important notes
Naming convention of files in this repository is based on the following regex but keep in my mind that the 'course name' and the 'professor name' are optional as they are implicitly determined by folder and subfolder at which the file is located.
###### regex:
- ([course name]-)?([professor name]-)?((HWs|slides|project|lecture notes|final|midterm)-)(1396|1397|1398|1399|1400|1401|1402)(fall|spring)(-(answer))?
###### example:
- subfolder: Database/Ghadiri
- file name: final-1401-fall
- answer file name: final-1401-fall-answer
